/* ----------------- Text based blackjack game ------------- */

/*
    This is a simple text based blackjack game coded in rust. The game plays
    as follows:
    > the player will be asked to bet from their bank (initially value of Â£100)
    > the player will be shown two cards
    > the dealers 1 card out of their two will be shown
    > the player will be given a choice to hit or stand
    > once the player stands, the dealer will continue to hit until their
        card value is above the players
    > whoever gets closest to 21 wins
    > whoever gets 21 wins (Blackjack)
    > a draw will occur if both players have the same hand value
    > whoever hits and their hand goes above 21, they go bust and the other
        player wins
    > at the end of the round the players bank either increases or decreases
        based on their bet, and the outcome of the round (win or lose)
    > at the end of each round the player can choose to continue playing
        or to quit
